# TDC Extractor

TDC (Total DOS Collection) Extractor is a Windows utility that lets you filter and extract particular Games from a Yearly TDC archive automatically.

I wrote this because I didn't want to manually extract and/or delete 100's of files.

As an added bonus, it can rename files to DOS 8.3 format if you wish to run these on Vintage hardware or a DOS VM.

Feel free to contributes feature requests / patches as the base is now in place.
